Image Captioning & Translation using BLIP + mBART

This project implements an AI-powered image captioning system that generates descriptive captions from images and optionally translates them into Arabic. It uses a hybrid pipeline combining BLIP for image caption generation and mBART-50 for multilingual translation.

The goal of the project is to explore vision–language models and understand how image understanding can be integrated with neural machine translation to produce coherent captions in multiple languages.

Project Overview

Built an image-to-text captioning system using BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training)

Integrated mBART-50 for English → Arabic translation

Trained and fine-tuned mBART on a bilingual English–Arabic dataset

Designed a simple Gradio-based web interface

Supports caption generation in English or Arabic

Enables real-time image upload and caption prediction

Key Concepts

Computer Vision

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Image Captioning

Transformer Models

Vision–Language Models

Neural Machine Translation (NMT)

Text Tokenization and Sequence Generation

Model Fine-Tuning

Model Architecture
1. BLIP — Image Encoder & Caption Generator

Extracts visual features from the input image

Generates an initial English description

Provides high-quality captions with vision–text attention

2. mBART-50 — Machine Translation

Receives the English caption from BLIP

Translates it into Arabic using a fine-tuned many-to-many model

Handles tokenization, sequence generation, and decoding

3. Combined Pipeline
Image → BLIP → English Caption → mBART (optional) → Arabic Caption

Dataset (for Translation Fine-Tuning)

The mBART model was fine-tuned on a parallel English–Arabic dataset.

Preprocessing steps included:

Lowercasing

Removing special characters

Text normalization

Tokenization

Padding and truncation

Building DataLoader for batches

Results

Generates accurate and coherent English captions from images

Produces high-quality Arabic translations of the generated captions

Demonstrates the strength of combining vision–language and NMT models

Fully deployable through a Gradio GUI

GUI Access

A simple and interactive GUI was built using Gradio:

Upload an image

Choose the output language (English or Arabic)

Receive a generated caption instantly
